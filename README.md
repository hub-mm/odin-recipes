The current project I am working on is building a basic website, showcasing Spaghetti Recipes.
<p>This requires setting up a basic HTML website structure.</p>
<p>As well as working on CSS and getting a basic style to the website.</p>
 
<p>On the website you'll find 3 delicious, standard italian spaghetti recipes.</p>
